                        In the post-COVID-19 scenario in India, with its continuing lockdown boredom and pandemic induced-health conscience,
                        the popularity of pedal power is growing among the locals in Kashmir.

                        People are now more concerned with their health as a result of learning about the effects of COVID-19,
                         such as the rise in thyroid disorders and especially childhood obesity.

                        Keeping it in view to provide residents of Srinagar with an open -gym setting, the government installed exercise 
                        equipment in parks so that anyone who can't afford a gym membership can utilize the equipment at no cost.

                        Tanzeela Akhter, a 23-year-old working professional, makes frantic calls to her companions before embarking on their early-morning adventure as the first rays of daylight appear on the horizon.

                    <p>
                        I used to travel two kilometers each day to get to work. I decided to cycle with my friends, 
                        because offices, including mine, were closing due to the pandemic, Akhter stated, as she stopped 
                        her ride, keeps me re-energized.

                        They join others along Srinagar's gorgeous Boulevard and ForeShore Road as it arcs around Dal Lake while wearing sports suits, safety equipment, and big smiles. They are a part of a new fad that is sweeping the small, frequently difficult city: regular rides across the roads and trails of the valley for an increasing number of cyclists.

                    <p>
                        Since schools and workplaces were both shut down during the lockdown, more and more women and girls started participating in sports and other physical activities. Cycling quickly gained popularity as the best choice, appealing to both men and women due to its convenience and health benefits.

                    <p>
                        "I've been cycling frequently since the shutdown. Hurmah Shah, an 18-year-old college student from Shalimar in Srinagar, says, "I was at first the only female in my neighbourhood but now many more have joined.”

                        People in the health sector believe that the pandemic stimulated a health sensitivity among the masses and young people in particular.

                        According to Balbir Singh, the Srinagar district sports officer of the Jammu and Kashmir’s department of youth service and sports, physical fitness activities provide a glimmer of hope in the face of rising social ills, which range from drug abuse to mental health problems and deaths. He adds further, “Apart from jogging, a number of women have taken to cycling.”

                    <p>
                        According to the National Mental Health Survey 2015–16, the prevalence of mental health issues is estimated to be 10.6% nationwide, but the Kashmir Mental Health Survey Report 2015 estimates it to be a staggering 45% in the valley, Balbir noted.

                        A local resident of Alamgiri Bazar said, "Earlier we did not have such facilities as the open-air gym in our area." The administration has established an open-air gym in our area. We are very thankful to the local administration who took such kind of initiatives for the benefit of the public”.

                        Unsurprisingly, there has been a rise in the number of bicycle shops set up in the last two years, despite the fact that the roads surrounding the picturesque Dal Lake are bustling with cyclists. Additionally, a significant number of bicycle businesses have popped up not just in Srinagar’s urban regions but also around the country.

                    <p>
                        Now that the taboos against cycling are fading, women and girls are cycling not only to stay healthy and physically active but also for the convenience of commuting. More women and girls are adopting the trend every week, and it is now typical to see them cycling to work, college, and other destinations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mohd. Yaseen, a cycle shop owner in Lal Chowk area of Srinagar said that cycling has gained momentum as a result sales have increased as well. “Cycling is not confined to only males nowadays as a lot of women also purchase it to remain healthy,” he said. “I have sold cycles ranging from rupees 10000 to rupees 30000 and the demand is increasing rapidly,” he added.
