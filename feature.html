                        Bilal Ahmed is a mathematics teacher and innovator from Srinagar, Kashmir. He has invented the affordable electric car that runs on solar energy. Bilal has been working on this project for over 13 years and ultimately, achieved the milestone. Ahmed has named his car YMC after his children “Yosha and Maisha.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ahmed wanted to make a car for the disabled but couldn’t due to financial constraints. He said they used watched and studied various luxurious cars since 1950. The solar car does not only give a luxurious feel but is also affordable for the common people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The car’s structure was built from a made-in-Japan Nissan Micra which he bought from a second-hand market. He is a b.tech student and has no knowledge about the building of a car. But over the years, he spent his time reading books to get knowledge on how to build a car. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ahmad achieved a great feat. He created the car without financial assistance from the government or another organisation. For this project, he set aside 40% of his salary. “Yes, I did assist mechanics in their shop. However, all of the concepts originated from me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ahmad spent more than Rs15 lakh on this lone undertaking over 13 years. But he claims that if he were to repeat the process, the cost would be little more than Rs. 7-8 lakhs. “Because I relied on trial and error, it cost me a lot of money. The devices occasionally worked and occasionally didn’t. But if I had to do it over again, a person from the middle class could afford the car
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initially, Ahmad had intended to add to standard gasoline or diesel-powered vehicle to boost the economy. He tried using hydrogen gas but had to abandon it due to technical issues. “At this point, I started researching solar energy. Sometimes solar panels are not very effective. I started looking into the various solar panels’ power output and efficiency. I contacted several exporters and producers before settling on monocrystalline solar panels that are specially created and produce more energy than other solar receptors. Ahmad has installed solar panels on most of the vehicle’s exterior, including the bonnet and the back windshield.

                    <p>
                        The car has a dual system, which uses battery power first. Additionally, the vehicle receives automated solar charging while it is in motion. Until now, Ahmad had relied on ineffective temporary batteries. The car can travel roughly 40 to 50 kilometres after two to three hours of charging. The automobile can go up to 100 km on a full charge if you swap out the old batteries for lithium-ion ones, though. Compact and lightweight lithium batteries must be imported from China and are pricey.

                    <p>
                        The work Ahmad is doing is not done yet. He wants to reduce the car’s weight and make it more aerodynamic. “I want to be able to improve the car’s appeal and usability for customers. He said that weight adjustments will increase the car’s speed and mileage Anand Mahindra, the head of the Mahindra Group, learned of Ahmad’s situation last week and tweeted his support. “Several local media outlets and journalists told me that Anand Mahindra had tweeted about my accomplishment. He enquired as to my interest in working with them. When I read it, I was delighted and attempted to get in touch. For the time being, it’s still in the works, adds Ahmad.
