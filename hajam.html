                        People don’t want them to get their hair cut by them, thinking that they are unprofessional and unhygienic too, which costs this community heavily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a July morning in 2022, sexagenarian Abdul Hameed parks his rusty bicycle near the police post at the general bus stand in Anantnag. He begins organizing his tiny and packable barbershop. He then gently placed the folded curtain against a 2-foot mirror on the wooden surface against the fixed wooden chair meant for the customer.
                    </p>
                   </div>

                  <div class="img-div w-100 tx-c ">
                    <img src="./img-20220905-wa0012-02.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        He aligns two wooden chairs, placing their backs facing one another. A big umbrella was unveiled to cover both the divided chairs, supported by the rear of the chair meant for the customer. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He cleans the top of the customer’s chair to ensure their sitting posture is safe and comfy.  Later adjusted the mirror on the opposite side, appropriate enough for the customer to see their own face. Followed by this, he unrolls his cloth-laden bag consisting of the barber’s instruments and places them in a little cabinet beneath the mirror.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Abdul Hameed has been starting off his business days for the past 40 years in this manner. Under an umbrella, he and his fellow barber, Ismail, shave and trim people’s hair to meet their ends.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Abdul asked Ismail, “Have you paid your Rs. 20-day rent to the municipality?” The response was “No” with a blank expression from the latter. Abdul was furious at having to pay it despite being away from the work.
                      </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="w-100 tx-c">

                    <p>
                        The two “tapre nayud” (street barbers) inherited this long-standing profession of the craft of hair cutting and styling from their fathers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abdul Hameed leads this hereditary profession with the utmost passion while sporting gleaming eyes on his aged face. Although managing the conventional barbershop is not very beneficial to him regarding the family finances, his commitment to maintaining the generational compliance commands amazement and respect for the roots.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The endearing sight of Abdul Hameed and Ismail tending to the needs of their clients in the busy byways of Anantnag is cause for committed reflection.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                    <p>
                        Going to work early in the morning isn’t as inspiring as it would appear. In the eyes of society, street barbers are subject to severe humiliation and mockery. The fact that they are despised by society because of their employment must be their biggest problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a result of clients ignoring their “outdated” services, this poses a severe obstacle to their business. As a result, the majority of customers are from lower social classes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abdul Hameed says, after cutting the hair of Zahoor Ahmed, his second client of the day, “Our target clients are largely tribal people and those who travel from far-flung locations.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Few people need to get their hair done while traveling, and as soon as they see us, they come over without thinking twice.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="w-100 tx-c">
                    <img src="./barb-1.jpeg" alt="">
                    <p>
                        Many people hesitate to employ their services because they are concerned about what others would think of them if they got their haircut in the middle of nowhere on the side of the road.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ismail, who travels 35 kilometers every day to support his family, claims that some people avoid us because they think our instruments aren’t as sterile and clean as those used in modern barbershops.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ismail, 65, explains as he wipes sweat from his brow from the intense afternoon sun that people from lower social levels tend to favour street barbers because of their lower prices.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        For a haircut, they charge Rs. 20, and for a haircut and shave, they charge Rs. 40.  He claims we make between 350 and 400 rupees a day. “It’s incredibly challenging to sustain oneself on such a meagre wage.”
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Up until the early 1980s, local barbershops were the only option for hair styling on the streets. Customers from all socioeconomic levels would use their services and be incredibly happy. However, throughout time, a number of causes have contributed to their reduction.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        The fact that street barbers were never able to advance with the times is also a contributing element. They didn’t make enough money to be able to use contemporary hair-cutting and styling techniques. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The barber shops used the most recent shaving creams, head massagers, and high-tech tools, and they kept up with all of the most recent hair-cutting and styling trends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This ultimately further reduced their customer base, leaving them to cater to a small segment of society.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="w-100 tx-c">
                    <img src="./sci-1.jpeg" alt=""> 
                    <p>
                        Street barbers and even local barbers were impacted by non-local barbers, which contributed to the demise of their industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because they could style hair in a way that the locals couldn’t, non-locals “started growing more popular, and their demand soared, suppressing us further,” claims Nazir.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The street barber begins putting everything back in his “nayud khyus,” or barber’s bag, exhausted from the day’s labour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a zillion thoughts cross his head, he softly wraps the mirror back with the curtain cloth. He begins cycling home as his legs are unable to support his weight and he is thinking about the chocolates he wanted to buy for his grandchildren with the Rs 360 he had made that day. He grinned, disappointed yet thankful.
